# i-love-you-deep happy valentine's day-
**my love, my deep,**  

you are my whole universe, my once-in-a-lifetime kinda love. I don’t think words will ever be enough to hold all the love I have for you, but I’ll still try—because you deserve to hear it, again and again.  

I wanna grow old with you, trace wrinkles on your face . I wanna wake up next to you in places we’ve never been before, watch sunsets from rooftops in cities we don’t know the names of. I wanna see the world with you, but more than that, I wanna see **you**—in your happiest, in your rawest, in your most vulnerable moments.  

I wanna be there when you win, celebrating you like the world should. And when things get heavy, when life feels like too much, I wanna be the arms you run to, the home you come back to. No matter what, I got you. Always.  

You deserve everything good, everything kind, everything magical. And if the universe won’t hand it to you, then I’ll spend my whole life making sure you get it. Because you? You’re my everything.  

forever & always,  
**choto baby.**
